# This simply prints what is written in between the quotations
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# This prints "Hens" and then displays the equasions result
print "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0
# The same happens here with the "Roosters"
print "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

# The same happens as in line 2
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# This calculates the equasion and prints its result
print 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

# This, again, prints the sentence between the quotations
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# This calculates both equasions, each before and after the "less than" symbol.
# Then it determines wether the first is, in fact, less than the second.
# Finally it prints either True or false. In this case it's False.
print 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0

# This is a manual representation of the automated process discribed in line 18

# This is our reaction after we have gone through line 19s process
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

# Apparently we are hungry for more math
print "How about some more."

# Now we are trying to figure out what line 21 actually is.
# Aha, so it is in fact greater
print "Is it greater?", 5.0 > -2.0
# Well since it is greater, the question of wether it's greater or equal is sort of unnecessary, don't you think?
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0
# Just to be sure that 5 is not equal to -2, we ask if it might be less or equal.
print "Is it less or equal?", 5.0 <= -2.0
